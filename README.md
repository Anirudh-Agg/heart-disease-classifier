# Heart Disease Classifier

## Overview

This project involves building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to classify heart disease presence using patient data. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
- **Model Training**: Implementing various machine learning models to predict heart disease.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Files Included

- `end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full machine learning pipeline.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Anirudh-Agg/heart-disease-classifier.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. Use the following command to install required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Notebook**: Open the `end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and execute the cells.

## Usage

- **Data Scientists**: Understand and improve the machine learning pipeline for heart disease classification.
- **Researchers**: Analyze the methodology and results for academic purposes.
- **Healthcare Professionals**: Gain insights into predictive models for heart disease.
